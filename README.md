# Distance-Visualizer
Calculate distances &amp; visualize them.
This is a Lua script that is only compatible with Anvil's prebuilt functions.

For in-game usage, hold down or click the left mouse button to get & visual the distance from you, to your crosshairs position.

For an in depth explanation, you can read documentation I've wrote [here](https://docs.anvil.team/examples/calculating-distances-tool).
